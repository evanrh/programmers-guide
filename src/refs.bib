In this report, we offer our perspectives on what constitutes software as a service, including the evolving business model and the core value proposition, the overall landscape including major participants and market growth, and analysis of competitive trends. The report also includes a spotlight of the on-demand CRM sector as well as a review of some of the other software categories with specific company examples and our viewpoint on the keys for success. Several major trends are identified including: Disruptive technologies with software as a service redefining ways to deliver and sell software; Growing end-user adoption being paved by emerging, privately-held software as a service companies; Endorsement becoming more mainstream with small, mid-market, and large enterprises alike increasingly replacing license relationships in favor of hosted applications; Mounting competitive tensions with software companies taking defensive positions \& maneuvers through internal devel-opment and/or acquisitions in reply to pressures posed by a new group of competitors; and}
